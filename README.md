# Fake Petroleum Suite 

🛠️ You know those IPS simulators like Gap, mbal, and Prosper that you wish you could afford? Well, now you can "kind of" have them. Our suite is like a Docker container that only has the README.md file. 🤣

🎮 Wanna simulate outputs or time delays? Say no more! We've got more dummy data than a Scrum meeting has jargon. Run OpenServer commands that are as functional as a return; statement in a void function. 🙃

# README

👨‍💻 Introducing the "FAKE PETROLEUM SUITE" or "FPS", a DLL file ready for deployment on your Windows environment `run register.bat`. And for those who love to build from source, you've got that option too. 🛠️ `build.bat && register.bat`

📊 Next up, create a CSV file within your connector's execution directory `call it commands.csv`. This file should contain all the commands, delays, and outputs you'd like your connector to handle. It's essentially your connector's roadmap. 🗺️

⚙️ Finally, configure your `config.yml` file to point to the SUITE's address. Once that's done, your connector will think it's communicating with actual simulators—sort of like mocking in unit tests but on steroids. 🚀

🎉 And there you have it—seamless integration with the illusion of real-time simulation. It's the reliable bridge between your connector and, well, "reality." 🌉
