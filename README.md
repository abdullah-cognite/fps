# Fake Petroleum Suite 

🛠️ You know those IPS simulators like Gap, mbal, and Prosper that you wish you could afford? Well, now you can "kind of" have them. Our suite is like a Docker container that only has the README.md file. 🤣

🎮 Wanna simulate outputs or time delays? Say no more! We've got more dummy data than a Scrum meeting has jargon. Run OpenServer commands that are as functional as a return; statement in a void function. 🙃
